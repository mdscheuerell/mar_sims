## This is a repository containing code and simulation results for Scheuerell et al. (in review)

The code here is generic, including models for multivariate autogregressive models. We denote these generally as MAR(1) or VAR(1) models when the approach does not include observation or measurement errors, versus MARSS(1) or VARSS(1) models. These models are all stationary, and can be differentiated from models with time-varying parameters (eg, [TVVARSS(1) models](https://github.com/nwfsc-timeseries/tvvarsshttps://github.com/nwfsc-timeseries/tvvarss)) .

## Simulations & fitting

The simulated data are based upon the parameter sets generated by the script `/R/01_make-grid.R`. The files `/R/02_sim-fit.R` and `/R/03_sim-fit-2surveys.R` first simulate the data and then fit them using the Stan code contained in `/exec/`.


## Model output and results

Raw results are included in the `/results/` folder. Due to file size limits, results have been broken down into a series of files (eg, `posterior_summaries_1.rds`, `posterior_summaries_2.rds`, etc).

## Plotting

Plotting scripts for replicating plots in the paper are in the '/plotting scripts/' folder. The plots themselves are included in the `/plots/` folder.
